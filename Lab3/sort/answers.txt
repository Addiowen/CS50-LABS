sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:  When considering the time it takes to sort the sorted50000.txt file for each sort program. Sort1 took
                    the least time to sort the sorted list. That means sort1 uses Bubble sort as the sorting algorithm.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: When feeding the 3 programs the random50000.txt it took 7.914s for the sort1 program to sort the file.
                    It took 0.654s for the sort2 program to sort the file. And it took 3.534s for the sort3 program to sort
                    the file. So considering the time sort2 got the least time. That means sort2 uses the merge sort!

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: When considering the time it takes to sort the sorted50000.txt file for each sort program. Sort3 took
                    more time than other two sort programs. That means sort3 uses Selection sort as the sorting algorithm.
